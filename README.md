# Binary search tree has atmpst two node to every node
# smaller value node come in the left of the parent node
# greater value node than parent node value kept in the right of the parent node 
# this kind of arrangement makes the traversing easy and efficiently 
# this code contain inset and delet function of binary search tree 
# if any one can optimise this solution will be appricaited.
